title: Alex's Portfolio & Résumé
---

Hello!

This website hosts my [résumé](/résumé) and
[portfolio](/portfolio). I have seen several job listings,
conference sign-ups, or social events which have a field for a
portfolio website, so I've finally put one together.

It is still very much in progress! If something isn't on this
website, it doesn't mean I think it is unimportant or that I'm
not interested in that technology. I'm taking things one step at
a time.

You can peek at [the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/AVerm/alexjvermillion) that this
site is built from if you're curious about my ability to use
[HTML](https://github.com/AVerm/alexjvermillion/search?l=html),
[CSS](https://github.com/AVerm/alexjvermillion/search?l=css)
(including
[SCSS](https://github.com/AVerm/alexjvermillion/search?l=scss)),
[Markdown](https://github.com/AVerm/alexjvermillion/search?l=md),
and
[Git](https://github.com/AVerm/alexjvermillion/commits/master/).
It's not the most technically-impressive accomplishment,
publishing a site through the GitHub pages free (public) tier,
but I had to make a site anyways so I hope to get a second use
out of the effort.

Thanks,
Alex Vermillion
